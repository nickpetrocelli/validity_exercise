**README**

*Build info*

This project is built using gradle. To build the project, run the
'gradle build' command while in the project's directory.

*Description*

This app parses the normal.csv file and places output at a webpage, launched at
localhost:4567/parse. Input currently isn't formatted in a pretty manner;
however output is correct, as verified by a unit test in the test/ directory.

*To launch*

Currently launching via the jar does not work for unknown reasons.
However launching through an IDE (Intellij, here) works.
